- Tests terug laten werken

IsGlobal() gebruiken en functies proberen te testen die het gebruiken

- split equals in sounds/componentinfo
-	implement componentInfoEquals()
- make sure my menu items dont disappear :) doesnt do it anymore.. dont know how this came to be
- move equalcomponentinfo to voicepackcomparer and test (test exists but need to be rewritten)
- move equalfilenames to voicepack comparer and rewrite tests. is EqualAchievementList
- extract equals functions to VoicepackComparer
    - implement equalComponentData
    - implement xmldictionary length
- add messagebox or something, when recombine (or after restart) cant find the voicepacks
- create at least one test without pak problem for mergecomponentdata

- bug: useCombinedVoicepack_Changed, _useCombinedVoicepackMenuItem.Checked can be called from the timer thread aswell, need synchronized access
VoicepackCombinerForm I think . useCombinedVoicepack-_Changed
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171728.aspx

- the first voicepack loaded in recombine is still in the list, though it didnt load properly (I think), check that
  - start with default would solve the problem I guess?
  - remove duplication in add and recombine, starting with default would help, seems to different to really remove any duplication
  - remove redundant if

finish FindPAKReferenceInVoicepackAndChangeIntegrationTest
create functionality to clean voicepacks of too much componentData
test creating a new voicepak and then adding a image file and see how it is stored in the voicepack datastructure: pretty sure its groupManagerBackgroundImage
implement find pak reference (to adjust to doubles in componentdata)
implement fixdoubles
move merge component data to voicepackmerger
finish TestVoicepackMerger.MergeComponentInformation
finish move of all merge functions to VoicepackMerger
check if componentdata get created for combined pack with also xml based packs inside
make old style voicepacks work when they are not in the right folder, walk through it trying to play a sound with eventsimulator mod

Create a standard named settingsfile.

create tool to remove excess datacomponent data

remove restriction for old soundpacks to have to be in the recursion folder
    
create new testdata packs, and revisit those tests to make them more clear

(start merge met default soundpack)

Extract VoicepackCombiner

merge in eigen klasse refactoren

fix error where data is kept when new voicepack is created via main gui


My plugin is dependant on PS2Plugin being loaded properly, maybe should build check?

Manual items:
--------------
It takes the sampleImage of the first voicePack added to the list, TODO: make option to choose sample Image, maybe rightclick context menu?
